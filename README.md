This is a fan project made for RDCWorld1, inspired by their video "How Game Developers feel when a Simple Game Blows Up", which features a Stickman game that made an additional apperance in
"How Video Game Developers really feel about Twitch Streamers". 

This fan made game has two versions

Version 1. This version features a "Red Light, Green Light" mechanic, where the players can only move when the light/circle turns green. https://github.com/CashMoneyKwam/Stickman/releases/tag/V1

Version 2. This version is the same recreation you see in the RDCWorld1 videos, and is just regular jumping to the middle. https://github.com/CashMoneyKwam/Stickman/releases/tag/V2

In both Version 1 and Version 2, the player cannot hold down the movement key, they have to prove they are the better player by pressing the buttons at a faster speed. 

CONTROLS: 

There is only one movement command for each player, which is to jump towards the "Dub" button, every keybinding listed below is simply alternative keybinds that the player can press to move.  

The keyboard bindings for Player 1 (Red) are "A"
The Xbox bindings for Player 1 (Red) are "X", "Y", "A," "B", "RT(RightTrigger)", and "LT(LeftTrigger)"

The keyboard bindings for Player 2 (Green) are "L"
The Xbox bindings for Player 1 (Green) are "X", "Y", "A," "B", "RT(RightTrigger)", and "LT(LeftTrigger)"

Unfortunately there isn't any input/keybinding remapping. Maybe it will be implemented in version 2.0.
