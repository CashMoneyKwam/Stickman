This is a fan project made for RDCWorld1, inspired by their video "How Game Developers feel when a Simple Game Blows Up", which features a Stickman game that made an additional apperance in
"How Video Game Developers really feel about Twitch Streamers". 

This fan made game has two versions

Version 1. This version features a "Red Light, Green Light" mechanic, where the players can only move when the light/circle turns green.

Version 2. This version is the same recreation you see in the RDCWorld1 videos, and is just regular jumping to the middle. 

In both Version 1 and Version 2, the player cannot hold down the movement key, they have to prove they are the better player by pressing the buttons at a faster speed.
