DESCRIPTION: 

This is a fan project made for RDCWorld1, inspired by their video "How Game Developers feel when a Simple Game Blows Up", which features a Stickman game that made an additional apperance in
"How Video Game Developers really feel about Twitch Streamers". 

Demonstration Video (Tutorial for MEland): 

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Stickman is a game made for 2 players, whose goal is to jump towards the middle and reach the "Dub" button first. 

Both Player 1 and Player 2 are equidistant from the "Dub" button. While the screen/camera may or may not look symetrical, both Players are mapped out 800 units from the Dub button on both sides.

VERSIONS: 

This fan made game has two versions

Version 1. This version features a "Red Light, Green Light" mechanic, where the players can only move when the light/circle turns green. https://github.com/CashMoneyKwam/Stickman/releases/tag/V1

Version 2. This version is the same recreation you see in the RDCWorld1 videos, and is just regular jumping to the middle. https://github.com/CashMoneyKwam/Stickman/releases/tag/V2

In both Version 1 and Version 2, the player cannot hold down the movement key, they have to prove they are the better player by pressing the buttons at a faster speed. 

CONTROLS: 

The game is played on 1 PC, either 2 players share a keyboard, or they plug in 2 different Xbox controllers. 
The game should recognize the different Xbox controllers, so that the same buttons won't move both players.

There is only one movement command for each player, which is to jump towards the "Dub" button, every keybinding listed below is simply alternative keybinds that the player can press to move.  

The keyboard bindings for Player 1 (Red) are "A"
The Xbox bindings for Player 1 (Red) are "X", "Y", "A," "B", "RT(RightTrigger)", and "LT(LeftTrigger)"

The keyboard bindings for Player 2 (Green) are "L"
The Xbox bindings for Player 1 (Green) are "X", "Y", "A," "B", "RT(RightTrigger)", and "LT(LeftTrigger)"

Unfortunately there isn't any input/keybinding remapping. Maybe it will be implemented in version 2.0.

MESSAGE FOR RDCWORLD1: 

If RDC is reading this, my goal was always to become RDC's Audio Engineer/Tech Guy/Secondary Writer/etc. Everything I do is for lifetime friendships with good energy, I'm not interested in the bag, I just wanted to be big enough to be noticed by RDC. If you feel like you need a different person for ANY job, hit me up, because I truly don't care about being on camera, I just wanted to be part of the RDC family. I'll learn or do whatever it takes, because I've never seen a friendship as pure as RDC. All love, my boys, stay up.
